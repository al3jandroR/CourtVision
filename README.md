# CourtVision

> A full-stack NBA game prediction app using real-time data, injury reports, and machine learning.

CourtVision is an expansion of my original [NBA prediction model](https://github.com/al3jandroR/nba_predictions), which was developed as a class project in Google Colab using team statistics and classification models. This app takes that foundation and evolves it into a production-style web application.

---

## What It Does

CourtVision predicts NBA game outcomes using:
- Rolling team performance metrics (5-game averages)
- Real-time injury reports and player availability
- Opponent-based matchup features
- A trained ML model (Random Forest / Gradient Boosting)
- Caching of predictions in a PostgreSQL database (via Neon)
